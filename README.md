vim-github-links
================

A vim plugin to create github links.  

Purpose
================

This allows you to add a hotkey that will create a github link for you to the branch, file, and line number of the file you're currently editing.  It puts this link on your clipboard for easy sharing.

Installation
================
I recommend vundle, in your ~/.vimrc:
```
Bundle 'dapplebeforedawn/vim-typing-practice'
```
and then you can :BundleInstall

Use
================
Once installed you can use the default hotkey of `<leader>gl` when editing a file.  This craft a github link to the branch, file, and line and put it on your clipboard.  It will also be echoed for you to see.  





Feedback
================
Please feel free to give any and all feedback or pull requests.
